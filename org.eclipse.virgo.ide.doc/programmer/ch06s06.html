			The Virgo Tomcat Server provides out-of-the-box support for deploying
			standard Java EE WAR files. In addition support for
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Libraries</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Services</em></span>
			WAR formats provides a logical migration path away from standard,
			monolithic WARs toward OSGi-enable Web applications. The PAR packaging
			and deployment format enables truly fine-grained, loosely-coupled, and
			efficient application development. In general, the migration steps
			presented in this chapter are fairly straightforward, but developers
			should set aside time for some up-front design of the bundles themselves.

			It is recommended that you take another sample application or
			indeed your own small application and go through this migration
			process yourself. This will help you better understand the concepts and
			principles at work.  In addition, it is highly recommended that you
			familiarize yourself with the Eclipse-based
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Virgo Tools</em></span> support which is discussed in
			<a class="xref" href="">???</a>.
