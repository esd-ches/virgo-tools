		Taking on a new technology such as OSGi may seem a bit daunting at first,
		but a proven set of migration steps can help ease the journey. Teams
		wishing to migrate existing applications to run on the Virgo Tomcat Server
		will find that their applications typically fall into one of the following
		categories.

		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
					<span class="bold"><strong>Web Application</strong></span>: for web applications,
					this chapter provides an overview of the steps required to migrate
					from a Standard WAR to a Shared Services WAR. Furthermore, the following
					chapter provides a detailed case study involving the migration
					of the Spring 3.0 Form Tags show case application.
				</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
					<span class="bold"><strong>Anything else</strong></span>: for any other type
					of application, you will typically either deploy your application
					as multiple individual bundles, as a single PAR file, or as a plan,
					which is the recommended approach for deploying applications on
					the Virgo Tomcat Server. See <a class="xref" href="ch05s02.html" title="Migrating to a Plan or a PAR">Migrating to a Plan or a PAR</a> for details.

			Many applications may start with the standard WAR format for web applications and
			gradually migrate to a more OSGi-oriented architecture. Since the Virgo Tomcat Server 
			offers several benefits to all supported deployment formats, it provides a smooth
			migration path. Of course, depending on your application&rsquo;s complexity and your
			experience with OSGi, you may choose to start immediately with an OSGi-based
			architecture.

				If you are not yet familiar with OSGi or simply want to deploy an existing web application on the Virgo Tomcat Server,
				you can deploy a standard WAR and leverage the VTS with a minimal learning curve. In fact reading the 
				<a class="ulink" href="../../virgo-user-guide/html/index.html" target="_top">Virgo Tomcat Server User Guide</a>
				is pretty much all that you need to do to get started. Furthermore, you will gain
				familiarity with the Virgo Tomcat Server, while preparing to take advantage of the other formats.

				The <span class="emphasis"><em>Shared Libraries WAR</em></span>
				format is the first step to reaping the benefits of OSGi. In this phase, you dip your toes into OSGi-based dependency
				management by removing JAR files from the WAR and declaring dependencies on corresponding OSGi bundles.
			</p></div><div class="section" title="Shared Services WAR"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="migrating-to-osgi-web-shared-services-war"></a>Shared Services WAR</h3></div></div></div><p> In this phase, you take the next step toward a fully OSGi-based architecture by separating your web artifacts
				(e.g., Servlets, Controllers, etc.) from the services they depend on.</p></div><div class="section" title="Web Migration Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="migrating-to-osgi-web-summary"></a>Web Migration Summary</h3></div></div></div><p>
				The following diagram graphically depicts the migration path from a Standard WAR to a Shared Services WAR.
				As you can see, the libraries (<span class="emphasis"><em>libs</em></span>) move from within the deployment artifact
				to the Bundle Repository.
				Similarly, the services move from within the WAR to external bundles and are accessed via the
				OSGi Service Registry. In addition, the overall footprint of the deployment artifact decreases
				as you move towards a Shared Services WAR.
