			packages. Traditionally, if an OSGi bundle wished to make extensive use of such a framework its manifest would
			have to import a huge number of different packages. This can be an error-prone and tedious process. Furthermore,
			application developers are used to thinking in terms of their application using a framework, such as Spring, as a
			whole, rather than a long list of all the different packages that comprise the framework.
		</p><p>The following figure provides a simple illustration of the complexity of only using <code class="code">Import-Package</code>:

		</p><p>Virgo reduces the need for long lists of imported packages by introducing two new manifest
			headers; <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> and <code class="code">Import-Library</code>. The following figure provides an
			illustration of the simplification that these new headers offer:

			As you can see, use of <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> and <code class="code">Import-Library</code> can lead to a dramatic reduction
			in the number of imports that you need to include in an application bundle&rsquo;s manifest. Furthermore, <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code>
			and <code class="code">Import-Library</code> are simply aliases for <code class="code">Import-Package</code>; at deployment time <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code>
			and <code class="code">Import-Library</code> header entries are automatically expanded into numerous <code class="code">Import-Package</code> entries. This
			means that you retain the exact same semantics of using <code class="code">Import-Package</code>, without having to go through the labourious
			process of doing so.

					A disadvantage of using <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> or especially <code class="code">Import-Library</code>, is that the application 
					bundle has a greater apparent fan-out than it strictly needs. An Alternative is to use a tool such as bnd or Bundlor 
					to generate the package imports of the bundle.

				When working with a scoped application, such as a PAR file or a plan, you might run into a situation where one of the bundles in the application (call it <code class="code">bundleA</code>) depends on another bundle (<code class="code">bundleB</code>) that performs a runtime task (such as class generation) that a third bundle (<code class="code">bundleC</code>) might need to know about, although <code class="code">bundleC</code> does not explicitly depend on <code class="code">bundleB</code>.  
			</p><p>
				For example, Hibernate uses CGLIB (code generation library) at runtime to generate proxies for persistent classes.  Assume that a domain bundle in your application uses Hibernate for its persistent objects, and thus its <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> manifest header includes the Hibernate bundle.  Further assume that a separate Web bundle uses reflection in its data-binding code, and thus needs to reflect on the persistent classes generated by Hibernate at runtime.  The Web bundle now has an indirect dependency on the Hibernate bundle because of these dynamically generated classes, although the Web bundle does not typically care about the details of how these classes are persisted.  One way to solve this dependency problem is to explicitly add the Hibernate bundle to the <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> header of the Web bundle; however, this type of explicit-specified dependency breaks the modularity of the application and is not a programming best practice.
			</p><p>
				A better way to solve this problem is to specify that Virgo itself dynamically import 
				the bundle (Hibernate in the example above) to all bundles in the application at runtime.  
				You do this by adding the <code class="code">import-scope:=application</code> directive to the <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> header 
				of the bundle that has the direct dependency (the domain bundle in our example).  At runtime, although the Web bundle 
				does not explicitly import the Hibernate bundle, Virgo implicitly imports it and thus its classes are available 
				to the Web bundle.  This mechanism allows you to declare the dependencies you need to make your application run,
				without having to make changes to your application that might limit its flexibility. 
			</p><p>
				The following example shows how to use the <code class="code">import-scope</code> directive with the <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> header:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
Import-Bundle: com.springsource.org.hibernate;version="[3.2.6.ga,3.2.6.ga]";<span class="bold"><strong>import-scope:=application</strong></span></pre><p>
		You can also set the <code class="code">import-scope</code> directive to the (default) value <code class="code">bundle</code>; in this case, the scope of the bundle is just the bundle itself and thus Virgo does not perform any implicit importing into other bundles of the application.  
	    </p><p>
		Note that use of the <code class="code">import-scope:=application</code> directive of the <code class="code">Import-Bundle</code> header only makes sense when the bundle is part of a scoped application (PAR or plan);  if the bundle is not part of a scoped application, then this directive has no effect.
	    </p><p>
		Finally, because <code class="code">import-scope:=application</code> implicitly adds a bundle import to each bundle of the PAR or plan, the impact of subsequently refreshing the imported bundle is, in general, broader than it would have been if you had not used <code class="code">import-scope:=application</code>. This may well affect the performance of refresh.

			    Libraries are defined in a simple text file, typically with a <code class="code">.libd</code> suffix. This file identifies the
			    library and lists all of its constituent bundles. For example, the following is the library definition for
			    Spring 2.5.4:

<span class="bold"><strong>Library-Version</strong></span>: 2.5.4
<span class="bold"><strong>Library-Name</strong></span>: Spring Framework

			    Rather than encouraging the packaging of all an application&rsquo;s dependencies within the application itself, Virgo
			    uses a local provisioning repository of bundles and libraries upon which an application can depend. When the Virgo
			    encounters an application with a particular dependency, it will automatically provide, from its provisioning repository,
			    the appropriate bundle or library.
			</p><p>
			    Making a dependency available for provisioning is simply a matter of copying it to the appropriate location in the
			    Virgo&rsquo;s local provisioning repository. By default this is
			    <code class="literal">SERVER_HOME/repository/usr</code>. A more detailed discussion of the provisioning
			    repository can be found in the <a class="ulink" href="../../virgo-user-guide/html/index.html" target="_top">User Guide</a>.
